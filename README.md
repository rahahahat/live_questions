# live_questions

A web service to allow live speakers, lecturers and teachers to manage their students' questions.

## Notes:

You can now go to localhost:3000/info while server is running to see room data

### Tom Todo:
- [x] change Instance to Room
- [x] handle question delete serverside
- [ ] add user permissions so that only author/moderator can delete questions
- [ ] figure out a way of making server.js more readable
- [ ] create a uuid to use as room url rather than user defined - can still define a name for the room to be displayed like a "title"
- [ ] question text sanitisation for security and bad word filtering
- [ ] room passwords
- [ ] room expires and is deleted after x hours of inactivity
- [ ] moderator can mark questions as answered
